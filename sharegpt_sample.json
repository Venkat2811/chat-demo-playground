    "prompt": "Write me the start of a script for a movie scene, with dialogue and stage directions, based on the below information:\n\nA locked room in Arena TV’s headquarters in Redhill, Surrey, formed the centre of a scheme to defraud lenders out of £282 million. There, Arena’s owner, Richard Yeowart, forged labels with false serial numbers as he cooked up a plan that was to become the UK’s biggest-ever fraud in asset-backed lending.\nExplosive court filings in a civil claim against Yeowart and his fellow director Robert Hopkinson allege how the pair spent company funds on cryptocurrency, a house in Barcelona costing €1.8 million (£1.5 million), and transferred £950,000 from the company to a personal bank account.\nArena TV collapsed into insolvency last November, two days after Yeowart sent an email to staff telling them to cease trading, leaving more than 50 lenders nursing heavy losses related to debts secured against equipment that either did not exist, or had already been secured by another lender.\nYeowart, 54 and Hopkinson, 41, have since absconded, their whereabouts unknown.\nAdministrators from Kroll said that 55 lenders, including high street banks such as NatWest and Clydesdale Bank and a string of boutique lenders, had provided hundreds of millions in loans. Most were secured against assets that did not exist. Only nine of them had any verified assets to back up their lending.\nFounded in 1988, Arena TV provided outside broadcast services to everything from the Six Nations rugby to Glastonbury festival. The company, which had bases in Redhill and Biggin Hill, in Kent, provided trucks, equipment, such as cameras, and services to customers including the BBC, Sky Sports and ITV. When it collapsed, its trucks were already on the way to Wembley to cover an England game.\nThe Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal investigation, and last month announced the arrests of two individuals, understood to be separate from the defendants in the civil claim.\nYeowart, described as a “quiet man” by his former employees, is a former cameraman with a passion for aircraft, who regularly commuted to work in a helicopter from his home in East Grinstead, West Sussex. Hopkinson joined the company in 2003 and was marketing director.\nIn December 2019, when it last filed financial statementsbefore its collapse, Arena Holdings reported sales of £33.6 million, up from £32.9 million in 2018. It also reported pre-tax profits of £4.2 million, up from £3.2 million a year earlier.\nHowever, details have emerged about the alleged fraud since the company’s collapse. Court filings, brought against Yeowart and Hopkinson by administrators to Arena, allege a complex fraud involving a company registered in Hong Kong, undisclosed bank accounts and complicit intermediaries.\nIn 2012, Yeowart set up a new company, Sports Online Limited, registered in Hong Kong. According to court filings, Sports Online was used by Yeowart to perpetrate the fraud.\nIt is alleged that through a circular scheme, he would arrange for the wrongful “sale” of equipment by Arena or Sports Online to an intermediary company, which appeared to be involved in the alleged fraud. The intermediary then sold it on to an asset-backed lender. This “equipment”, much of which did not exist, would then be the subject of a hire purchase agreement between Arena and the lender, which did not handle the goods itself.\nAccording to the claim, Yeowart would send pictures of the equipment with their false serial numbers — along with false certificates — to the lender to show that Arena had taken delivery of it.\nThis was done to conceal the fact that the equipment did not exist and had not been procured from a third-party supplier in the ordinary course of business.\nIt is also alleged that Yeowart told the intermediaries the price to be put on these false invoices — substantially in excess of the market price. The intermediaries were paid a commission of 1 per cent of the inflated purchase price.\nArena allegedly operated undisclosed bank accounts, which were used to carry out the fraudulent schemes.\nAlong with creating false invoices, Yeowart is accused of misappropriating company funds.\nIn September 2019, he opened a cryptocurrency account with Luno Money, transferring €275,280 and £480,500 of company money into the account. He also transferred £950,000 from the company to an account in his name. In the same year, Hopkinson and Yeowart used €1.8 million of company money to buy a seafront home in Sitges, close to Barcelona. Sitges has been described as the Saint-Tropez of Spain thanks to its glitzy beach crowd. Arena’s remaining assets have been auctioned off and staff still have little clue about what went on behind Yeowart’s locked door.\nA defence has not been filed.",

Roran was curled up on the floor with a blanket and pillow as his mother read him fairytales. Her voice was soft and warm, like the fire, and it wrapped around Roran like a hug. He loved evenings like this. He loved listening to his mother tell stories and the scratching of his father’s quill. He often joined them for stories and the three spent most of their evenings in this room before Roran was sent to bed.\nRoran was the only child of King Daris and Queen Jaelin. He knew they wished to give him siblings, but for reasons he didn’t understand, they wouldn’t. So they showered him in as much love as they had to give. And he was happy. Even at the young age of four years old, he knew how much they loved him and he loved them. Even though they were King and Queen, they spent as much time as they could with him, including times like this.\nBut this evening took a surprising turn. The door to the library burst open and Mage Kevala was standing in the doorway, a shocked look on her face.\n“Your Majesties!”\n“Kevala? What is the meaning of disrupting us at this hour?” King Daris stood from the small desk where he had been writing, his voice angry.\nRoran sat up. Kevala looked like she was about to cry and it struck Roran as odd. She had always been so strict and controlled. It was weird to see her emotions so open. Roran, suddenly scared, ran over to his mother and she drew him up into her lap, comforting him with a hug.\n“It’s Greschel.”\nThe King’s anger disappeared, “Greschel? What’s going on?”\nKevala looked back and forth between the King and Queen and she revealed a folded parchment. Roran pulled away a little from his mother’s embrace, his curiosity winning out over his fear. The King took the parchment, and even in the dim light of the fire, Roran could see the colour drain from his face.\n“Greschel is… dead!”\n“What?” The Queen’s arms loosened around Roran and her mouth had dropped open.\nRoran’s father turned around, his face blank with grief, “He had decided to travel north alone, before his company was ready to travel with him. He got sick and died before the healer could get there. I don’t understand. How could this happen?”\nThe room went quiet. Greschel had been the High Mage of Ascai and advisor to their majesties. Roran didn’t really know Greschel. The few times he had met the man, it had been brief, rather scary encounters. Greschel was tall and wore a scowl like his father wore a smile; all the time. Roran hadn’t liked him too much and always felt that Greschel had been watching him, disappointment and displeasure surrounding him like a cloud.\nBut Roran knew that his parents had liked him and their grief filled the room.\nRoran looked at Kevala. She looked back at him, fear in her eyes. As the King walked back over to the Queen, Kevala raised a hand like she was going to say something, but seemed to decide not to and stayed quiet. Her eyes lingered on Roran and he shifted uncomfortably in his mother’s lap, her frightened gaze igniting a new fear in Roran, though he couldn’t understand why. He turned back to his mother, who now had silent tears running down her face. He leaned into her and let her wrap her arms around him as she cried.\n\n####\n\nFeedback in CSV format:",

    "prompt": "I envision this project supporting all of Jayhawks Rising by designing, collecting, coordinating, presenting and reporting on all relevant data that would inform decisions to see each objective succeed over time, and by leading decisions on a strategic ordering of sub-projects to gain leverage and reinvest those gains on future endeavors. Here is an outline of Jayhawks Rising:\n\nThe university of Kansas has a university-wide mission called Jayhawks Rising. The three mission-based institutional priorities for Jayhawks Rising are “Student Success”, “Healthy and Vibrant Communities”, and “Research and Discovery”. Thirteen objectives were identified under the three priorities. Each objective has co-leaders – deans and vice provosts with responsibilities tied to the objective – who will guide our efforts, involve stakeholders and lead implementation of strategies and action steps and help ensure continuous progress and success. Here is an outline of the thirteen objectives:\nSTUDENT SUCCESS\n· Increase Enrollment: We aim to expand our diverse community of ambitious and talented students, increasing access to a world class education for more first time freshman, new transfers, returning and graduate students. We will expand the reach of KU programming to connect to Jayhawks near and far, through on campus courses, around the nation in virtual formats, and across the globe.\n· Assure Retention and Completion Through Student Engagement and Satisfaction: While student presence, persistence, and performance are indicators of a satisfied student population, it is also meaningful to assess and monitor student engagement and satisfaction directly. Engaged and satisfied students are more likely to retain, ultimately complete, and pass on the message that KU is a fantastic choice for higher education.\n· Support Student Long-Term Success by Improving Placement & Reducing Debt: While earning a degree from KU is part of why students attend KU, what they do with that degree is also of great importance. Additionally, the cost of higher education remains prominent in students’ minds when selecting a higher education institution.\n· Assure Quality of Academic Programs: No matter the domain, Jayhawks aspire for quality. When a student comes to KU, we must provide them with an excellent academic experience. By constantly raising the bar and meeting new challenges, we will ensure that our students receive an education that goes beyond the standard.\nHEALTHY & VIBRANT COMMUNITIES\n· Strengthen Service to Local and Global Communities: Strengthening our service to local and global communities provides opportunities for our talented staff, faculty, and students to impact expansive programs near and far from KU. The volume and quality of services provided reflects our aspiration to impact communities across the world.\n· Improve Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging: With the ever-changing landscape of our country, and world, it is important to the University of Kansas that we make changes that create an environment of fairness, respect, and belonging. All students, staff, and faculty should have the greatest opportunities to meet their academic and professional goals. KU will examine and expand programs in order to meet our aspirations.\n· Improve Health and Wellness: There is more to academic success than grades and graduation. At the University of Kansas, we want all our Jayhawks to have the highest quality of life. In addition to physical health and wellness, we will focus on providing an environment where students, staff, and faculty are supported with adequate benefits and resources, are safe on campus, and have their basic needs met.\nRESEARCH AND DISCOVERY\n· Grow KU Research: Research at KU has an acclaimed record of discovery and innovation at the local, regional, national, and global level. Growing KU research across the university allows us to continue to solve problems, ask new questions, inform leaders and policy makers, and inspire others.\n· Recruit, Retain and Recognize Top Researchers: Central to a robust and impactful research enterprise are exceptional humans. Attracting highly productive and innovative researchers enhances KU’s ability to conduct research that advances society. Retaining these gifted individuals requires KU to build a research support system that matches their ambitions to make discoveries that change the world and gain recognition for their work. Through financial and administrative support, KU will recruit, retain and recognize researchers working at the highest level, building a research enterprise that is impactful to the state, nation and beyond.\n· Expand the Impact of KU Research in Kansas and Beyond: The University of Kansas aims to be an exceptional learning community that lifts each other, contributes to the wider scholarly enterprise and advances society. To measure and expand the impact of our research, KU focuses on research contributions in three key areas: academia; projects focused on core communities in our home state and beyond; involvement of students in research and their training to become future researchers.\n· Promote Innovation and Entrepreneurship: KU research impacts society in ways that go way beyond contributing to the more traditional idea of academic knowledge. Notably, KU research translates into inventions, products and business startups that provide health, economic, education and other benefits for society.",

The purpose of the `Loadable` class is to enable efficient loading and caching of instances of its subclasses. The instances are loaded in chunks and are stored in a cache to avoid loading the same data multiple times, which helps to prevent the N+1 problem.\n\nThe `Loadable` class provides several methods for loading, retrieving, and manipulating instances:\n\n1. `load(ids: Iterable[str])`: Preloads instances for the given ids, calling the `_load_func` if necessary.\n2. `get(id: str)`: Retrieves an instance from the cache or falls back to using the `_load_func`. Returns `None` if no instance was loaded for the given id.\n3. `maybe_get_or_raise(id: str | None)`: Calls `get_or_raise` only if the id is non-`None`.\n4. `get_or_raise(id: str)`: Calls `get` and raises a `ValueError` if no instance was loaded for the given id.\n5. `bulk_get(ids: Iterable[str])`: Fetches instances from the cache or falls back to using the `_load_func`. Returns only loaded instances in an arbitrary order.\n6. `purge(ids: Iterable[str])`: Removes instances from the cache. By default, purged ids are reloaded on the next `_load_func` invocation to help prevent N+1 problems.\n7. `has(id)`: Checks if an instance is already in the cache. Does not return `True` for unprocessed ids from `load` calls.\n8. `put(id: str, instance: T)`: Saves an instance into the cache.\n9. `_load_func(ids: Sequence[str])`: Fetches instances for the given ids. Must return a key-value pair for each id. A value of `None` indicates that no instance was loaded. This method should be implemented by the subclasses of `Loadable`.\n10. `_loader()`: Obtains or constructs the `Loader` for the `Loadable`.\n\nTo use the `Loadable` class, a class needs to subclass `Loadable` and implement the `_load_func` method. The `Loadable` class is also generic, which means it can be typed with the type of instances it will load (denoted by the type variable `T`).\n\nThe `LoadableConfig` class is used to store configuration parameters for a `Loadable`, and is used by the `Loader`. The `LoadableConfig` has two attributes: `chunk_size`, which is the maximum number of ids passed to the `_load_func`, and `max_request_workers`, which is the maximum number of concurrent requests to the `_load_func`.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help understanding specific parts of the code, please let me know!",

    "prompt": "Add features like Key takeaways and subheadings In this article, we'll look at the Take It Down tool, which is a new online service that allows teens to take control of explicit images and videos of themselves on the internet. The tool was created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and in part funded by Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram.\nThe Take It Down tool allows anyone to create a digital fingerprint of an image anonymously, without uploading any actual images. The fingerprint, known as a hash, is then added to a database that tech companies agreed to participate in, such as Meta's Facebook and Instagram, Yubo, OnlyFans, and Pornhub, which is owned by Mindgeek. The participating platforms will then remove the images from their services. However, if the image is on another site or sent in an encrypted platform such as WhatsApp, it will not be taken down.\nTake It Down is specifically designed for people who have reason to believe that their images are already out on the web, or that they could be. For example, teens who are dating someone and share intimate photos or those who are extorted for images. The tool is meant to give teens control over their images without involving law enforcement, which may not be anonymous.\nMeta attempted to create a similar tool back in 2017 called StopNCII or nonconsensual intimate images, aka “revenge porn”. However, the tool didn't go over well as it asked people to send their encrypted nudes to Facebook, which was not a trusted company even in 2017. The company tested out the service in Australia but did not expand it to other countries. In 2021, Meta helped launch a tool for adults called StopNCII. The site is run by a U.K. nonprofit, the UK Revenge Porn Helpline, but anyone around the globe can use it.\nMany tech companies already use the hash system to share, take down, and report images of child sexual abuse to law enforcement. The goal is to have more companies sign up for the Take It Down project. Twitter and TikTok have not committed to the project yet.\nMeta's new tool is called \"Take It Down\" and is operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. It allows teens or their parents to anonymously submit photos or videos they fear might be uploaded to the internet or that have already been distributed online. The photos are converted into digital fingerprints known as hashes, which are sent to NCMEC and shared with platforms. The social media sites use hash-matching technology to find and block any attempts to upload the original images. The other participating platforms are Yubo, OnlyFans, and Pornhub, owned by Mindgeek.\nMeta's new tool aims to combat the rising problem of ‘sextortion,’ where children are coerced or deceived into sharing intimate images with another person online, then threatened or blackmailed with the prospect of having those images published on the internet. Meta's global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said Take It Down is one of many tools the company uses to address child abuse and exploitation on its platforms. The site works with real as well as artificial intelligence-generated images and “deepfakes,” which are created to look like real people saying or doing things they didn't actually do.\n\nIn addition, Antigone Davis, Meta's global head of safety, emphasized that the tool is just one of many ways the company is working to address child abuse and exploitation on its platforms. She said they have reporting and blocking systems on their platform, and they also do different things to prevent such situations from happening in the first place, such as not allowing unconnected adults to message minors.\nHowever, Take It Down is a big step forward in the fight against online exploitation of children and teenagers. With its help, they can take control of their digital footprint and regain some sense of privacy and security. And with more tech companies signing up, the tool can become even more effective in preventing the spread of explicit images and videos.\nIt's worth noting that Take It Down is not a substitute for involving law enforcement in cases of online exploitation. While it may be more comfortable for teens to use the site, reporting such incidents to the authorities is still crucial for ensuring that perpetrators are held accountable and preventing them from victimizing others in the future.\nIn conclusion, the new online tool Take It Down, operated by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and funded in part by Meta Platforms, is a promising development in the fight against online exploitation of children and teenagers. The tool lets anyone anonymously create a digital fingerprint of explicit images and videos, which participating tech companies can then use to remove them from their services. While there are some limitations, such as the tool not being able to remove images from other sites or encrypted platforms, it's still a significant step forward in giving teenagers more control over their digital footprint and preventing the spread of explicit content online.",

    "response": "This code defines a class `Layout_Hooks` that extends `Loader`. The class has three public methods, `vs_carousel`, `vs_category_carousel`, and `vs_instructor_carousel`, which are shortcodes that generate HTML for displaying carousels of posts, categories, and instructors, respectively. Here are some potential improvements you could make:\n\n1. Use better variable names: Some of the variable names are not very descriptive, such as `$atts` and `$query_id`. You could consider using more descriptive names, such as `$shortcode_attributes` or `$carousel_query_id`.\n2. Use type hints: Type hints can make code easier to read and understand, especially for someone who is not familiar with the codebase. You could consider using type hints for the method parameters, such as `vs_carousel(array $atts, string $content = '')`.\n3. Remove commented out code: There is a commented-out block of code in the `vs_carousel` method that appears to be a parameter documentation comment. You could remove this code since it's not doing anything and might be confusing.\n4. Remove unnecessary static variable: The `$defaults` variable in the `vs_carousel` method is only used once to merge with the `$atts` parameter. You could consider just merging the defaults directly into the `$atts` parameter and removing the static variable.\n5. Refactor repetitive code: The `vs_carousel` and `vs_instructor_carousel` methods have similar code for saving the query ID and handling random order. You could consider extracting this logic into a helper method to reduce duplication.\n6. Consider using namespaces: If this code is part of a larger project, you might want to consider using namespaces to avoid potential naming conflicts with other code.\n\nOverall, the code seems relatively clean and easy to read. I hope these suggestions are helpful!",

The class has three public methods, `vs_carousel`, `vs_category_carousel`, and `vs_instructor_carousel`, which are shortcodes that generate HTML for displaying carousels of posts, categories, and instructors, respectively. Here are some potential improvements you could make:\n\n1. Use better variable names: Some of the variable names are not very descriptive, such as `$atts` and `$query_id`. You could consider using more descriptive names, such as `$shortcode_attributes` or `$carousel_query_id`.\n2. Use type hints: Type hints can make code easier to read and understand, especially for someone who is not familiar with the codebase. You could consider using type hints for the method parameters, such as `vs_carousel(array $atts, string $content = '')`.\n3. Remove commented out code: There is a commented-out block of code in the `vs_carousel` method that appears to be a parameter documentation comment. You could remove this code since it's not doing anything and might be confusing.\n4. Remove unnecessary static variable: The `$defaults` variable in the `vs_carousel` method is only used once to merge with the `$atts` parameter. You could consider just merging the defaults directly into the `$atts` parameter and removing the static variable.\n5. Refactor repetitive code: The `vs_carousel` and `vs_instructor_carousel` methods have similar code for saving the query ID and handling random order. You could consider extracting this logic into a helper method to reduce duplication.\n6. Consider using namespaces: If this code is part of a larger project, you might want to consider using namespaces to avoid potential naming conflicts with other code.\n\nOverall, the code seems relatively clean and easy to read. I hope these suggestions are helpful!"

First, I will remind you of the description in Chapter II Methods that shows how the results should look like. Just take in the information and let me know if you have questions. The actual request will follow shortly.\n\n------------------\n\\subsection{Information retrieval tests}\nTo ensure the quality of the search results returned by our IR system themselves, we also perform a series of information retrieval tests. These tests measure the accuracy and completeness of the search results, which is naturally a major requirement for all three interviewed users. During the tests, a focus is set on measuring the recall of the system, which is crucial in this scenario, as missing even a single relevant patent can have serious consequences. For example, David has voiced the requirement to identify possible infringement issues using the search engine. For this, it must clearly be able to find \\textit{all} relevant or similar patents, given a search term or patent. Also, if support for filing patents, a requirement of John, would be implemented on the platform, making sure the patent is unique would also be a major requirement. The focus on recall is explained in more detail later on.\n\nWe use an established dataset of patents for our tests, consisting of a wide range of patent documents with varying levels of complexity and technical detail. We measure the performance of the system using several metrics, including Precision-and-Recall, and nDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain). Precision measures the proportion of retrieved results that are relevant to the user's query. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP):\n\\begin{equation\\*}\n\\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n\\end{equation\\*}\nA high precision score indicates that the search engine is returning mostly relevant results, while a low precision score indicates that many of the results are irrelevant. Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of relevant results that are retrieved by the search engine. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN):\n\\begin{equation\\*}\n\\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n\\end{equation\\*}\nA high recall score indicates that the search engine is returning most or all of the relevant results, while a low recall score suggests that many relevant results are being missed. In the context of patent search it is especially important to optimize for recall, as it is critical to ensure that all relevant patents are returned in the search results. This makes recall a much more important metric in our case than in more general search engines. Still, precision is clearly also important for the ease-of-use of the system and should not be neglected completely.\n\nThe normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) is another metric commonly used in information retrieval. It takes into account both the overall relevance and the position of the retrieved item in the search results. It is defined as\n$$nDCG\\_k = \\frac{DCG\\_k}{IDCG\\_k}$$\nwhere $k$ is the rank position up to which the metric is calculated (e.g. the first page of results), $DCG\\_k$ is the Discounted Cumulative Gain at rank $k$, and $IDCG\\_k$ is the Ideal Discounted Cumulative Gain at rank $k$. The Discounted Cumulative Gain is calculated as\n$$DCG\\_k = rel\\_1 + \\sum\\_{i=2}^k \\frac{rel\\_i}{\\log\\_2 i},$$\nwhere $rel\\_i$ is the relevance score of the $i$-th search result. The Ideal Discounted Cumulative Gain is the $DCG\\_k$ of the search results in the ideal order. The nDCG is therefore a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is a perfect result. In our case, nDCG is important because it allows us to not only consider relevance, but also the rank position of retrieved patents. It for example provides a way to weigh more recent or popular patents more heavily, which is a way to fulfill all interviewed users requirement to stay up to date with industry trends.\n \nIn addition to testing the baseline version of our search engine, we also evaluate the performance of the different helper features and advanced search features tested in the Online Controlled Experiments to investigate their impact on the search results. Overall, the information retrieval tests help us to identify areas for improvement in the IR system and to point out way to fine-tune its performance to optimize the recall. It is important that the system returns all relevant patents, so it can provide the users with a comprehensive and accurate image of the patent situation given various search terms or conditions.",

    "prompt": "This is the abstract of my study: \"Immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) is a promising learning and teaching tool for learning a second/foreign language. However, interactive iVR studies remain in their infancy, with more research required to validate what and how it can be useful. This study focuses on the listening dimension and evaluates the impact of interactive iVR with avatars with realistic animations and lip synchronization, and object interaction, when compared to traditional listening exercises. The results were favourable and indicated that interactive iVR positively impacts the users’ knowledge retention when compared to traditional listening. Likewise, the users revealed a preference for the use of iVR for learning when compared to traditional listening exercises, as well as higher user satisfaction with the iVR experiment.\"; This is more info: \"Previous studies have shown that the use of avatars with realistic animations and movements and featuring lip synchronisation positively influences the users’ sense of presence, and a more enjoyable overall quality of experience \\cite{peixoto2021evaluation}. Moreover the use of object interaction and navigation not only had an overall positive impact, it introduced significantly cybersickness to users than without interaction and navigation.\nFactoring all of this in, we aimed to create an authentic representative cultural VE (for users learning English as a second language) that takes advantage of iVR systems, by replicating a fictional scenario of a clothing store somewhere in England. The VE experience encompassed avatars with realistic animations, lip synchronisation, and object interaction by the user. This paper investigates the impact of this interactive iVR experience on knowledge retention when compared with traditional listening exercises. Moreover, this case study also aims to understand the effect on user satisfaction, sense of presence, immersive tendencies, cybersickness, and their personal preference for which of the technologies they would prefer to use in the future for learning.\": This is the methods and sample: \"This study contrasted 2 learning activities, regarding the listening dimension, in a within-subjects design: traditional listening exercise and interactive iVR. The sampling technique used was the non-probabilistic convenience sampling method.\n\n\\subsection{Sample}\nThe sample comprises of 13 participants aged between 20 and 23 (M=21.15, SD=1.068). This study was conducted using the convenience sampling technique with participants recruited in classes of Computer Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering and/or Multimedia courses from University of [BLINDED]. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. \" ; This is the Procedure: \"All the equipment is disinfected before the experience itself, from the VR equipment to the pen to fill in the questionnaires. Participants were tested individually in a room with a controlled environment. A sociodemographic questionnaire was given before the beginning of the experience. The user would start the experiment with listening scenario which takes around takes 02:36 min. Once the audio ends, the user would fill the 10 questions test based on referred scenario. After that, the participant was then directed to the centre of the room, where a brief explanation of how to work with the Oculus Quest 2 controllers was given (Fig. \\ref{fig:user}). The experiment was preceded by a tutorial scene, without the NPCs.

However, interactive iVR studies remain in their infancy, with more research required to validate what and how it can be useful. This study focuses on the listening dimension and evaluates the impact of interactive iVR with avatars with realistic animations and lip synchronization, and object interaction, when compared to traditional listening exercises. The results were favourable and indicated that interactive iVR positively impacts the users’ knowledge retention when compared to traditional listening. Likewise, the users revealed a preference for the use of iVR for learning when compared to traditional listening exercises, as well as higher user satisfaction with the iVR experiment.\"; This is more info: \"Previous studies have shown that the use of avatars with realistic animations and movements and featuring lip synchronisation positively influences the users’ sense of presence, and a more enjoyable overall quality of experience \\cite{peixoto2021evaluation}. Moreover the use of object interaction and navigation not only had an overall positive impact, it introduced significantly cybersickness to users than without interaction and navigation.\nFactoring all of this in, we aimed to create an authentic representative cultural VE (for users learning English as a second language) that takes advantage of iVR systems, by replicating a fictional scenario of a clothing store somewhere in England. The VE experience encompassed avatars with realistic animations, lip synchronisation, and object interaction by the user. This paper investigates the impact of this interactive iVR experience on knowledge retention when compared with traditional listening exercises. Moreover, this case study also aims to understand the effect on user satisfaction, sense of presence, immersive tendencies, cybersickness, and their personal preference for which of the technologies they would prefer to use in the future for learning.\": This is the methods and sample: \"This study contrasted 2 learning activities, regarding the listening dimension, in a within-subjects design: traditional listening exercise and interactive iVR. The sampling technique used was the non-probabilistic convenience sampling method.\n\n\\subsection{Sample}\nThe sample comprises of 13 participants aged between 20 and 23 (M=21.15, SD=1.068). This study was conducted using the convenience sampling technique with participants recruited in classes of Computer Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering and/or Multimedia courses from University of [BLINDED]. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. \" ; This is the Procedure: \"All the equipment is disinfected before the experience itself, from the VR equipment to the pen to fill in the questionnaires. Participants were tested individually in a room with a controlled environment. A sociodemographic questionnaire was given before the beginning of the experience. The user would start the experiment with listening scenario which takes around takes 02:36 min. Once the audio ends, the user would fill the 10 questions test based on referred scenario. After that, the participant was then directed to the centre of the room, where a brief explanation of how to work with the Oculus Quest 2 controllers was given (Fig. \\ref{fig:user}). The experiment was preceded by a tutorial scene, without the NPCs. The aim was to allow the subjects, who could not be familiar with virtual environments, to become accustomed to manoeuvring the HMD, learn how to use the controllers to teleport and interact, and trying to mitigate the novelty effects for users with no familiar with VR technology. \"; This is the conclusion: \"iVR is a promising learning and teaching tool for learning a second/foreign language.

    "prompt": "based on the feedback you gave earlier, does this version better address your concerns about specific examples \n\nIn 2016, I had the opportunity to visit India with my family, one of the places we visited was my dad’s childhood town. Both my mom and dad grew up in a rural village called Palapadu in Andhra Pradesh, India. Many families have very low incomes and as a result, can’t prioritize proper access to health care. I’ve always heard about the effects of improper healthcare, but saw it firsthand when my dad took me to a medical camp being held in the village. This experience was eye-opening, the villagers hadn’t had health check-ups in years and many of them had life threatening diseases. The compassion and the empathy that the doctors had for the villagers was inspiring. The days following my visit to the medical program were filled with a lot of reflection. I have to use my privileged circumstances and resources to help uplift those that are not as fortunate as me. I’ve since built a hobby of learning about the importance of healthcare access and better understanding healthcare systems and resources. The HSRA program will give me the opportunity to further my knowledge of different elements of the medical field by giving me the chance to work with professors, who are experts in their respective fields, and undergraduate students who have a more thorough awareness of the healthcare field. \nI’ve taken numerous medical-related courses over the past few years as a result of my interest in the medical field. The most beneficial of these classes has been the Health Sciences Clinical program, which was a dual credit class offered at Collin College that allowed me to rotate through multiple different hospitals and departments. Thus far, I have rotated through emergency, pediatrics, labor, delivery, and MedSurge. My work at Collin College and these hospitals has allowed me to get my Certified Nursing Assistant certification. This program gave me the exposure to work with a wide variety of healthcare professionals, which has given me the insight to more deeply understand the healthcare field. More importantly, I was able to learn how to interact and empathize with patients who are facing different circumstances, something I had never really considered before the CNA program. Further, I was able to take the first steps to becoming an established individual in my healthcare career. Recently, I was accepted into the Health Sciences Practicum program, which is another dual credit program with Collin College which will help me attain the Patient Care Technician License during the 2023 - 2024 academic year. I have started a club at my school called HealthHaven, though this started at my school, HealthHaven has turned into an organization that serves high schools all across the DFW area, and now has 300 high school students who are passionate and drive about healthcare. HealthHaven recently had a fundraising campaign which allowed for the purchase of over $2000 worth of vital medication and supplies which were contributed to the Dharma Civilization Foundation, which works all across India to provide healthcare and spread information on proper healthcare. Through my work at HealthHaven, I gained valuable lessons in leadership, conflict resolution, and accountability. Over the summer of 2022, I was able to shadow at Texas Spine Consultants, where I watched multiple surgeries and learned about different spine-related ailments. My experience with the medical field has been fascinating, and I believe that the HSRA program will allow me to get exposure to cutting-edge research and ideas that I have yet to learn about.\n When I get older, I hope to become a pediatric oncologist. I really enjoy spending time with kids, their creativity and imaginative thought process really speaks to me, and make me feel as though I’m a kid. By being in this line of work, I hope to give back and help kids that are battling cancer. Previous research experience that students were exposed to included a range of different topics, one of which was cancer biology. Though this research might not be offered in the coming year, I am confident that the research offered will help advance the medical procedures that are used in the future, which will hopefully trickle down to ensuring a higher survival rate for pediatric cancer patients. The HSRA program will allow me to collaborate with peers who have similar interests, allowing me to develop and expand my knowledge. The program’s access to prominent professors will give me the opportunity to develop mentor relationships and learn from passionate people in the industry. As a supplement to the world-renowned staff, the program will bring guest lecturers to ensure students are exposed to ideas from all across the world. Finally, but, I think, most importantly, this program encourages a self-study model for students with undergrad researchers and professors as a secondary tool to help participants understand procedures and readings etc. the ability to learn how to conduct experiments on my own at my age will be invaluable. Overall, I am very excited about the HSRA program. I hope I have provided more insight into my prior experiences and the diverse background I can bring to this program.",

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe culverts\n107 I now turn to those aspects of Master Macready’s judgment in regard to the cross-claim in respect of which the Council appeals.\n108 The first finding of the Master that the Council challenged was that, despite the Master’s conclusion that Beckhaus had not complied with the specification in regard to the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts, there had been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts and in their immediate vicinity.\n109 There were 13 culverts in the levees Beckhaus constructed. The levees were not of a uniform height but, in parts of the levee, for example, the height was to be 1650 millimetres made up of compacted 150 millimetre thick layers. The culverts themselves were 600 millimetres deep.

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe culverts\n107 I now turn to those aspects of Master Macready’s judgment in regard to the cross-claim in respect of which the Council appeals.\n108 The first finding of the Master that the Council challenged was that, despite the Master’s conclusion that Beckhaus had not complied with the specification in regard to the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts, there had been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts and in their immediate vicinity.\n109 There were 13 culverts in the levees Beckhaus constructed. The levees were not of a uniform height but, in parts of the levee, for example, the height was to be 1650 millimetres made up of compacted 150 millimetre thick layers. The culverts themselves were 600 millimetres deep. The expert witnesses identified the culverts as parts of the levees that were particularly susceptible to erosion.\n110 Unlike the rest of the levees, the soil in the immediate vicinity of the culverts and up to a certain level over the culverts could not be compacted by using heavy machinery.

    "response": "Based on the code you provided, here are a few suggestions on how to refine your circle detection:\n\n1. Use a larger range for the radius estimation: It seems like you are providing a relatively small range of radii (Rmin = 10 and Rmax = 30) for the imfindcircles function. This could be one reason why additional objects are being incorrectly detected as screws. Try increasing the range of radii to see if it improves the detection accuracy.\n2. Use a lower sensitivity value: You are using a sensitivity value of 0.92 for the imfindcircles function. This means that the function is looking for circles that are very similar to the estimated radius range you provided. Try decreasing the sensitivity value to allow the function to detect circles that are less similar to the estimated radius range.\n3. Use a pre-processing step: Sometimes, applying some pre-processing to the image can help improve the circle detection. Consider applying a smoothing filter, such as a Gaussian filter, to the selected quadrant before running the circle detection algorithm.\n4. Use a different circle detection algorithm: If the above suggestions don't improve the accuracy of the circle detection, you might want to consider using a different circle detection algorithm, such as the Circular Hough Transform. This algorithm can be more robust to noise and other objects in the image.\n\nOverall, it's always a good idea to experiment with different parameter values and pre-processing steps to find the best approach for your specific problem.",

It enables users to navigate their entire data set in real time and find answers to their questions with just a few clicks. It is effective because it analyzes the entire data set each day, delivers a dashboard with complete analysis on key metrics, removes 99% of the noise from the data to focus on important and relevant segments, and is able to do in a fraction of the time and cost what would take hours and thousands of dollars per month to do with querying. It is particularly useful for payment processors as it can help them maximize growth metrics, prioritize security, understand why key metrics change and where to take action, and empower all employees to perform analysis across all data. Comparative differentiates itself from other solutions by telling users what is important, providing easy navigation through a single dynamic dashboard, and increasing speed and reducing costs through its lightening cache and proprietary algorithm."

    "response": "Introducing Seafood Laksa - A Spicy and Delicious Soup\n\nAre you ready to indulge in a flavorful and mouthwatering bowl of seafood laksa? In this recipe, we will explore how to make a tantalizing bowl of culinary bliss that combines fragrant spices, succulent seafood, and creamy coconut milk. In less than 30 minutes, you'll have a spicy soup that's bursting with flavor and is perfect for satisfying your cravings.\n\nLaksa Paste and Garnish\n\nTo start with, we will prepare the laksa paste, which is the foundation of this dish. Begin by heating three tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Then add a peeled and chopped onion and cook for five to six minutes until it softens. Add four medium red chilies, two teaspoons of Ginger paste, two minced cloves of garlic, a teaspoon of lemongrass paste, tablespoon of fresh coriander stalks, a teaspoon and a half of turmeric, half a teaspoon each of cumin and paprika, and a teaspoon of Tamarind paste. Mix all the ingredients together and fry them for another five minutes until they release a lovely fragrance. Once cooked, transfer the mixture to a mini chopper and blend it to form a paste.\n\nWhile the laksa paste is cooking, prepare a quick and simple garnish for the soup. In a small bowl, mix a teaspoon of rice vinegar, a teaspoon of caster sugar, finely chopped red chili, a finger-sized piece of cucumber that's been finely chopped, a quarter of a small red onion that's been finely diced, and a small handful of chopped coriander leaf. Combine the ingredients until they are well-mixed, and the flavors melt together while you work on the laksa paste.\n\nSeafood Laksa\n\nNow that you have the laksa paste ready, add it back into the frying pan, along with 200 mL of full-fat coconut milk, a teaspoon of fish sauce, and 300 mL of chicken or seafood stock. Stir all the ingredients together and bring them to a gentle simmer. Once the sauce is heated through, add in two cod or haddock fillets weighing about 140 grams or five ounces each. Allow the fish to cook in the broth for about four minutes, stirring occasionally until the fish starts to flake apart.\n\nAs the fish cooks, soak 200 grams or about seven ounces of dried rice or vermicelli noodles in boiling water for about three minutes. Once the fish is almost cooked through, add in 16 King prawns to serve four people, and cook them for another minute until they turn pink. Next, add 200 grams or about seven ounces of fresh bean sprouts and cook them for another minute or two until they are heated through. Then turn off the heat.\n\nTo serve, drain the rice noodles and divide them between four bowls. Top the noodles with the delicious seafood laksa, and finish each bowl with a tablespoon of the fresh and vibrant garnish made earlier. Your spicy Thai-inspired soup is now ready to be enjoyed.\n\nRequired Kitchen Tools and Equipment\n\n* Large frying pan\n* Mini chopper\n* Small bowl\n* Wooden spoon\n* Sharp knife\n\nTips and Variations\n\n* Use your preferred seafood combination, such as shrimp, squid, scallops, or fish.\n* Add vegetables like baby corn, sliced peppers, or bok choy to add more color and nutrition to the dish.\n* Substitute chicken or vegetable stock for seafood stock if you prefer.\n* Adjust the heat level by adding more or fewer chilies or using different types of chili peppers.\n* Use fresh or dried noodles according to your preference.\n* Add a squeeze of lime juice and a sprinkle of chopped peanuts for extra flavor.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)",

        "value": "Introducing Seafood Laksa - A Spicy and Delicious Soup\n\nAre you ready to indulge in a flavorful and mouthwatering bowl of seafood laksa? In this recipe, we will explore how to make a tantalizing bowl of culinary bliss that combines fragrant spices, succulent seafood, and creamy coconut milk. In less than 30 minutes, you'll have a spicy soup that's bursting with flavor and is perfect for satisfying your cravings.\n\nLaksa Paste and Garnish\n\nTo start with, we will prepare the laksa paste, which is the foundation of this dish. Begin by heating three tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Then add a peeled and chopped onion and cook for five to six minutes until it softens. Add four medium red chilies, two teaspoons of Ginger paste, two minced cloves of garlic, a teaspoon of lemongrass paste, tablespoon of fresh coriander stalks, a teaspoon and a half of turmeric, half a teaspoon each of cumin and paprika, and a teaspoon of Tamarind paste. Mix all the ingredients together and fry them for another five minutes until they release a lovely fragrance. Once cooked, transfer the mixture to a mini chopper and blend it to form a paste.\n\nWhile the laksa paste is cooking, prepare a quick and simple garnish for the soup. In a small bowl, mix a teaspoon of rice vinegar, a teaspoon of caster sugar, finely chopped red chili, a finger-sized piece of cucumber that's been finely chopped, a quarter of a small red onion that's been finely diced, and a small handful of chopped coriander leaf. Combine the ingredients until they are well-mixed, and the flavors melt together while you work on the laksa paste.\n\nSeafood Laksa\n\nNow that you have the laksa paste ready, add it back into the frying pan, along with 200 mL of full-fat coconut milk, a teaspoon of fish sauce, and 300 mL of chicken or seafood stock. Stir all the ingredients together and bring them to a gentle simmer. Once the sauce is heated through, add in two cod or haddock fillets weighing about 140 grams or five ounces each. Allow the fish to cook in the broth for about four minutes, stirring occasionally until the fish starts to flake apart.\n\nAs the fish cooks, soak 200 grams or about seven ounces of dried rice or vermicelli noodles in boiling water for about three minutes. Once the fish is almost cooked through, add in 16 King prawns to serve four people, and cook them for another minute until they turn pink. Next, add 200 grams or about seven ounces of fresh bean sprouts and cook them for another minute or two until they are heated through. Then turn off the heat.\n\nTo serve, drain the rice noodles and divide them between four bowls. Top the noodles with the delicious seafood laksa, and finish each bowl with a tablespoon of the fresh and vibrant garnish made earlier. Your spicy Thai-inspired soup is now ready to be enjoyed.\n\nRequired Kitchen Tools and Equipment\n\n* Large frying pan\n* Mini chopper\n* Small bowl\n* Wooden spoon\n* Sharp knife\n\nTips and Variations\n\n* Use your preferred seafood combination, such as shrimp, squid, scallops, or fish.\n* Add vegetables like baby corn, sliced peppers, or bok choy to add more color and nutrition to the dish.\n* Substitute chicken or vegetable stock for seafood stock if you prefer.\n* Adjust the heat level by adding more or fewer chilies or using different types of chili peppers.\n* Use fresh or dried noodles according to your preference.\n* Add a squeeze of lime juice and a sprinkle of chopped peanuts for extra flavor.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)"

    "prompt": "You are a strategist for a political campaigner. \n\n\"I am currently a Lecturer in Social Policy in the Department of Applied Social Studies in Maynooth. I teach courses at post-graduate and under-graduate level in housing, rights and inequality; civic engagement and civil society; the changing nature of the welfare state; and climate, social policy and inequality. \nI have researched and published in academic and policy fields of housing and social housing, spatial disadvantage, housing rights, economic inequality, neoliberalism and the welfare state, social justice, and social movements. I have a PhD in political and economic geography from Trinity College Dublin in 2009. \nMy most recent publication is the book, 'Housing Shock: The Irish Housing Crisis and How to Solve it' (Policy Press, 2020). It is a highly original book that was the first in Ireland to identify the emergence of Generation Rent, the distorting role of global investor funds in Irish housing, the profoundly damaging impact of homelessness on families, and identifying new solutions based on a based human rights vision for Irish housing and a practical policy pathway to ensure affordable, secure, decent quality and environmentally sustainable homes for everyone. It tackles one of the most pressing social crises facing contemporary Ireland. It makes a compelling case for enshrining the Right to Housing in our Constitution. It is written in a highly accessible, passionate way, that details the author’s personal journey from community worker to academic and activist and how his housing story interwove with his commitment and drive to achieve a human right to housing for everyone ins this country. The book is highly inspirational as it is not just as description of the crisis, but also provides direct voices of those affected, outlines solutions and offers pathways for citizens to engage in action to change the situation. In a short space of time the book has made a major contribution to the Irish policy debate on housing and to empowering those affected by the crisis and those trying to change it. The President of Ireland, in recognition of this contribution as a scholarly resource of national importance, invited the author to present the book to him personally in Aras an Uachtarain in June 2021. An academic review in the international journal Critical Social Policy describes the book as “a highly welcome and thoughtful addition to the debate about housing in Ireland, drawing on comparative examples, quantitative and qualitative data, and his engagement with the topic as both researcher and activist to do so”. \nWhile Leilani Farha, Global Director of the Shift and former UN Rapporteur on Adequate Housing 2014-2020, describes the book as providing a really important and insightful contribution to the global debate on financialisation, inequality and the right to housing.” The Irish Times described it as “a valuable book.

    "response": "Based on your extensive background in social policy, housing, and economic inequality, I would recommend the following strategy for your political campaign:\n\n1. Establish a clear, concise platform: Your platform should focus on the issues that matter most to you and where you have expertise, such as housing, economic inequality, and social justice. Develop clear policy proposals to address these issues, including the right to housing, affordable housing, and addressing spatial disadvantage.\n2. Build a strong narrative: Connect your personal journey from community worker to academic and activist to your political campaign. Emphasize your commitment to creating a more just and equitable society, and use stories from your research and personal experience to illustrate the real-world impact of the issues you're addressing.\n3. Engage with grassroots movements and community organizations: Collaborate with local groups working on housing, social justice, and inequality issues. These partnerships can help amplify your message, mobilize supporters, and provide valuable insights from the community.\n4. Utilize your academic and policy expertise: Highlight your research and publications as evidence of your deep understanding of the issues at hand. Use your experience working on EU and national social policy projects to demonstrate your ability to navigate complex policy environments and deliver results.\n5. Position yourself as a thought leader: Continue contributing to public discussions on social, economic, and political issues through media appearances, op-eds, and public events. Use these opportunities to emphasize your policy proposals and build your reputation as a knowledgeable and passionate advocate for change.\n6. Build a strong campaign team: Assemble a diverse team of experts and advocates who share your vision for a more equitable society. This team should include individuals with experience in policy, communications, grassroots organizing, and fundraising.\n7. Leverage endorsements: Seek endorsements from respected figures in academia, social policy, and activism, as well as individuals directly affected by the issues you're addressing. These endorsements can provide credibility and help broaden your appeal to voters.\n8. Engage with voters: Make an effort to connect with voters through town halls, community events, and social media. Listen to their concerns and be responsive to their needs. Use these interactions to refine your policy proposals and strengthen your message.\n9. Focus on key demographics: Target your campaign messaging and outreach efforts towards demographics most affected by the issues you're addressing, such as low-income households, renters, and marginalized communities.\n10. Stay adaptable and resilient: Be prepared to face challenges and adapt your campaign strategy as needed. Stay true to your vision and maintain a focus on the issues that matter most to you and the communities you aim to serve.",

I teach courses at post-graduate and under-graduate level in housing, rights and inequality; civic engagement and civil society; the changing nature of the welfare state; and climate, social policy and inequality. \nI have researched and published in academic and policy fields of housing and social housing, spatial disadvantage, housing rights, economic inequality, neoliberalism and the welfare state, social justice, and social movements. I have a PhD in political and economic geography from Trinity College Dublin in 2009. \nMy most recent publication is the book, 'Housing Shock: The Irish Housing Crisis and How to Solve it' (Policy Press, 2020). It is a highly original book that was the first in Ireland to identify the emergence of Generation Rent, the distorting role of global investor funds in Irish housing, the profoundly damaging impact of homelessness on families, and identifying new solutions based on a based human rights vision for Irish housing and a practical policy pathway to ensure affordable, secure, decent quality and environmentally sustainable homes for everyone. It tackles one of the most pressing social crises facing contemporary Ireland. It makes a compelling case for enshrining the Right to Housing in our Constitution. It is written in a highly accessible, passionate way, that details the author’s personal journey from community worker to academic and activist and how his housing story interwove with his commitment and drive to achieve a human right to housing for everyone ins this country. The book is highly inspirational as it is not just as description of the crisis, but also provides direct voices of those affected, outlines solutions and offers pathways for citizens to engage in action to change the situation. In a short space of time the book has made a major contribution to the Irish policy debate on housing and to empowering those affected by the crisis and those trying to change it. The President of Ireland, in recognition of this contribution as a scholarly resource of national importance, invited the author to present the book to him personally in Aras an Uachtarain in June 2021. An academic review in the international journal Critical Social Policy describes the book as “a highly welcome and thoughtful addition to the debate about housing in Ireland, drawing on comparative examples, quantitative and qualitative data, and his engagement with the topic as both researcher and activist to do so”. \nWhile Leilani Farha, Global Director of the Shift and former UN Rapporteur on Adequate Housing 2014-2020, describes the book as providing a really important and insightful contribution to the global debate on financialisation, inequality and the right to housing.” The Irish Times described it as “a valuable book. It is a tool for better understanding our current predicament and what we can do about it”. \nIn 2011 I published an academic peer\nreviewed book, ‘Public Private\nPartnerships in Ireland; Failed experiment or the way forward?’ (Manchester\nUniversity Press in 2011). \nI have also published in high quality international peer reviewed journals.

    "response": "Hello there! As a hair stylist who is an expert in managing frizzy hair, I'm excited to share some light-hearted tips and tricks to help you manage your frizz and achieve fabulous, frizz-free locks. Let's get started!\n\n1. What causes frizzy hair?\n\nFrizz is caused by a lack of moisture in the hair. When the hair is dry and lacks moisture, the hair cuticles lift and cause the hair to become frizzy. Humidity and heat can also contribute to frizz, as they can cause the hair to absorb moisture from the air and swell, which leads to frizz.\n\n2. How to style frizzy hair.\n\nStyling frizzy hair can be a challenge, but there are some tricks you can use to make your hair look great. To start, use a wide-tooth comb or a detangling brush to gently comb out your hair while it's still damp. This will help to minimize tangles and prevent breakage. For curly hair, use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer to help define curls and reduce frizz. If you have straight hair, try using a round brush while blow drying to smooth the hair and reduce frizz.\n\n3. How to dry frizzy hair.\n\nDrying frizzy hair can be a challenge, but there are some techniques you can use to help reduce frizz. Avoid rubbing your hair with a towel, as this can cause friction and lead to frizz. Instead, gently blot your hair with a microfiber towel or an old t-shirt to remove excess moisture. If you have curly hair, try plopping your hair with a t-shirt or microfiber towel to help define curls and reduce frizz. For straight hair, try air-drying or blow-drying with a cool setting to help smooth the hair and reduce frizz.\n\n4. What devices help manage frizzy hair?\n\nThere are a few devices that can help manage frizzy hair. One of the best devices for managing frizz is a hair dryer with an ionizing feature. Ionic hair dryers emit negative ions that help to break up water molecules and reduce frizz. The Jinri Paris Professional Infrared Ion Salon Dryer is a great option for managing frizzy hair. It's lightweight and equipped with advanced far-infrared and negative ionic technologies that maintain hair moisture and make it silky smooth. The dryer also protects your hair from damage and dullness.\n\n5. What products help manage frizzy hair?\n\nThere are a variety of products that can help manage frizzy hair. For starters, try using a hair serum or oil to help lock in moisture and reduce frizz. The Desert Beauty Premium Quality Argan Oil is a great option that's enriched with jojoba oil, coconut oil, and other natural ingredients that provide extra nourishment to your hair. If you have curly hair, try using a curl activator like the MopTop Curly Hair Custard Gel. It enhances the structure of wavy to kinky hair, adds definition, texture, and a natural sheen to the hair. The formula contains aloe vera, nettle, silk amino acids, sea botanicals, and honey, which offer maximum hold while moisturizing the hair.\n\nI hope these tips and product recommendations help you manage your frizzy hair and achieve the beautiful, frizz-free locks you deserve!

    "prompt": "Primary setting: The Luxian Empire\nThe Luxian Empire is a vast alien empire spanning more than half of its galaxy. Lux, the homeworld of the Luxite species, serves as the empire’s capital. Between 10-20 habitable planets house varying numbers of Luxian citizens spread throughout the galaxy. The Luxian society is technologically advanced and is ruled by an empress, who has absolute power over all aspects of life in the empire.\n\nThe Luxians are very technologically advanced. They have developed advanced weapons, perfected faster-than-light travel and teleportation (though on a small scale), eradicated many diseases, established very efficient public services, and incorporated advanced technology into every facet of life from hobbies to government operations. Even their architecture takes advantage of their discoveries and inventions to achieve previously impossible structures or designs.\n\nThis technological advancement has a dark side, however. Luxians are also obsessed with perfection and believe themselves, as a species and a civilization, to be perfect. Individuals feel this pressure as much as the society itself does. Anything that hinders their perfection must be suppressed or eliminated. Consequently, cosmetic habits - makeup, plastic surgery, mood-altering medications, specialized hair care, unique inventions (like contact lenses that make your eyes look “normal” if they are red or puffy) - are in high demand, although most Luxians don’t talk about using them because no one enjoys admitting that they need them.\n\nThe Luxians are also known for their strict laws and their belief in their own racial superiority. They do not tolerate peaceful coexistence with other alien nations for long. They believe they will ultimately dominate the galaxy, and see other civilizations as barriers to their advancement - barriers that must be destroyed.\n\nThe Luxians have a strong military, and they use their power and resources to conquer and wipe out other civilizations. The alien species that once made up those civilizations are reduced to mere slaves in the empire. Some work as servants, serving a Luxian master directly. Many others are forced to work in the empire’s mines, factories, and other industries. These slaves are treated poorly and have few rights, and they live in constant fear of punishment and abuse. While abolitionist groups and individuals do champion for the rights of aliens, slaves in the empire have functionally no rights and no legal path to freedom.\n\nIt’s been hundreds of years since the last time the Luxians found and conquered another civilization. In that time, the remnants of the enslaved aliens’ former cultures - language, traditions, religions - have all but been wiped out by Luxian oppression. Alien children are even raised apart from their parents in Luxian-run facilities known as “nurseries”, where the children are trained to serve future masters before being sold. The Luxians take great care to ensure their slaves have no memory of their people’s former lives.\n\nThe Luxians are also a very atheistic society. Their species has not had a religion of any sort for many generations now, as they believe they are the pinnacle of existence and the existence of any gods would be a threat to their perfection. Consequently, religion is highly discouraged among the Luxian citizens. A few believe in a New-Age-like universal consciousness, but that is about as religious as Luxians ever get. For slaves - many of whom come from religious societies - religion is outright forbidden and punished harshly. The Luxians tend to care less if the slaves adopt some of their New Age beliefs, however.\n\nOverall, the Luxian Empire is a ruthless and oppressive society that values power and control above all else. Its ruling class is wealthy and privileged, while its lower classes (particularly aliens) are oppressed and enslaved. \nLuxians/Luxites\n“Luxian” is the nationality belonging to the Luxian Empire. “Luxite” is the dominant species of the empire, originating from their homeworld, Lux.\n\nLuxites are tall, elegant humanoid creatures with long hair and large eyes. They average between 6-7 feet in height and live up to 120-150 years, and age proportionately. Their skin, hair, and eyes come in varying shades of pink, purple, and lavender. Both the men and the women have long, thick hair: the men tend to grow their hair out to shoulder length or slightly below, while the women grow their hair out at least to waist length, and often longer. Many Luxians see their hair as a symbol of their perfection and are obsessed with keeping it healthy and well-groomed.\n\nLuxians typically wear clothing comparable to traditional Indian garb. The men wear long, tunic-like tops and loose trousers. The women wear long skirts or pants with a crop top and flowing sashes or scarves, or sometimes a single-piece dress with an accompanying scarf. When necessary, they wear simpler clothing more optimized for space travel. Their military uniforms consist of black with silver accents, with additional markings for high-ranking officers. Royal guards wear a fancier version of the standard military uniform.",

    "prompt": "From the book 'Golden Grant Rules' by David Kincade:\n\nWHAT ARE GRANTS\n1. Grant definition\nWhat is a grant?\nIt is free money that you do not need to pay back.\nSaid more formally, a grant is a non-repayable and non-dilutive contribution from the government.\nI'm shocked how many times I hear an entrepreneur say, \"it sounds too good to be true.\" The reality is that governments are enormous with massive mandates; they cannot run every program. Grants are a clean way that governments can allocate capital to for-profits and non-profit organizations with accountability.\n2. Confusing but grants are rarely called grants\nGrants in government are called \"support, fund, initiative, program, plan, service, stream, solution, partnership, opportunity, access, or utilization.\"\nThe reality is that for governments and grant agencies, the word \"grant\" is a dirty word. Grants are one of the few words that last for generations, even though governments try to use every other name in the world to describe grants.\nGrants can be seen as \"free money\" or \"handouts,\" so opposition politicians can easily criticize grants. For this reason, governments are careful with words they use to describe grants. The problem is that people get confused in the language.\n7\nWHO RECEIVES A GRANT\n3. Grants go to for-profit businesses too\nMany government grants go to for-profit businesses. For some people, this sounds shocking.\nThe reality is that governments get elected to \"stir\" the economy, reduce GHG emissions, or help youth get jobs.\nGrants are usually reimbursed, so they are a simple way for governments to distribute cash to businesses. If the private company wins a grant, the government will reimburse it for the eligible expense (e.g., salary, equipment, or capital cost). This grant formula consistently works.\n4. Tier A grant organizations\nWhile it is tempting to dive in and start searching for grants, take a step back and determine if you are eligible first. To make that easy for you, here is a list of sectors where most government grants are available:\n1. Agriculture 2. Environment 3. Technology 4. Non-profit\n5. Indigenous\nIf you have determined that you are eligible for government grants, congratulations! It's time for you to move on to finding the right funding.\n8\n\n5. Tier B grant organizations\nTier B organizations still have millions of dollars of grants, but you need to search carefully. Here are the Tier B industries:\no Affordable Housing\no Arts & Culture\no Employment (hiring, recent graduates, or training grants) o Export\no Infrastructure\no Media (films, magazines, digital publications)\no Mining\no Municipality grants\no Tourism\n6. Universal grants\nNearly every business is eligible for two types of grants: summer students and training assistance.\nMany provinces have summer student programs. In Alberta, the grant is called the Summer Temporary Employment Program (Step), which opens and closes depending on the government in power.\nThe federal government has a summer grant called the \"Canada Summer Job Grant.\" Note that summer grants exist for Indigenous individuals to work anywhere as well.\n7. Unexpected industries eligible for grants\nSome industries receive grants that may surprise you:\no Military – you can find funds to celebrate events and encourage new technologies\n9\n\n8.\no\no\no\no o\nInternational Events - if you are hosting a major event, you can find grants because municipalities want to increase the economic impact\nTourism - governments fund tourism to increase international visitors to book hotels and spur the local economy\nAnniversaries - governments give grants to celebrate significant public milestones (e.g., 75 or 100 year anniversaries)\nFestivals - you can win grants to host significant festivals\nArts and culture - while you may expect grants for this sector, you will be surprised at the amount of money given to these sectors - it's massive and covers all aspects from digital to travel.\nUnderstanding export grants\nGovernments love export businesses because they can create tremendous growth potential, which grows manufacturing and innovation jobs at home - not to mention the tax base!\nAs ironic as it sounds, it can be easier to win grants to grow internationally than at home.\nThe Canadian federal government has export grants, and some provincial governments have programs as well.\nYou can expect to win funding for nearly all aspects of exporting: o Business travel\no Participation at trade fairs\no Market research\no Adaptation of marketing tools for a new market\no Legal fees associated with a distribution/representation agreement\nGrant tip: You need to get your application well in advance of travel; you need to plan ahead. Most applications ask if you contacted a local trade commissioner employee,\nso make sure you reach out to them early in the application process!\n10\n\nDo not forget to send a postcard to the trade commissioner from the country for which you won the grant!",

        "value": "From the book 'Golden Grant Rules' by David Kincade:\n\nWHAT ARE GRANTS\n1. Grant definition\nWhat is a grant?\nIt is free money that you do not need to pay back.\nSaid more formally, a grant is a non-repayable and non-dilutive contribution from the government.\nI'm shocked how many times I hear an entrepreneur say, \"it sounds too good to be true.\" The reality is that governments are enormous with massive mandates; they cannot run every program. Grants are a clean way that governments can allocate capital to for-profits and non-profit organizations with accountability.\n2. Confusing but grants are rarely called grants\nGrants in government are called \"support, fund, initiative, program, plan, service, stream, solution, partnership, opportunity, access, or utilization.\"\nThe reality is that for governments and grant agencies, the word \"grant\" is a dirty word. Grants are one of the few words that last for generations, even though governments try to use every other name in the world to describe grants.\nGrants can be seen as \"free money\" or \"handouts,\" so opposition politicians can easily criticize grants. For this reason, governments are careful with words they use to describe grants. The problem is that people get confused in the language.\n7\nWHO RECEIVES A GRANT\n3. Grants go to for-profit businesses too\nMany government grants go to for-profit businesses. For some people, this sounds shocking.\nThe reality is that governments get elected to \"stir\" the economy, reduce GHG emissions, or help youth get jobs.\nGrants are usually reimbursed, so they are a simple way for governments to distribute cash to businesses. If the private company wins a grant, the government will reimburse it for the eligible expense (e.g., salary, equipment, or capital cost). This grant formula consistently works.\n4. Tier A grant organizations\nWhile it is tempting to dive in and start searching for grants, take a step back and determine if you are eligible first. To make that easy for you, here is a list of sectors where most government grants are available:\n1. Agriculture 2. Environment 3. Technology 4. Non-profit\n5. Indigenous\nIf you have determined that you are eligible for government grants, congratulations! It's time for you to move on to finding the right funding.\n8\n\n5. Tier B grant organizations\nTier B organizations still have millions of dollars of grants, but you need to search carefully. Here are the Tier B industries:\no Affordable Housing\no Arts & Culture\no Employment (hiring, recent graduates, or training grants) o Export\no Infrastructure\no Media (films, magazines, digital publications)\no Mining\no Municipality grants\no Tourism\n6. Universal grants\nNearly every business is eligible for two types of grants: summer students and training assistance.\nMany provinces have summer student programs. In Alberta, the grant is called the Summer Temporary Employment Program (Step), which opens and closes depending on the government in power.\nThe federal government has a summer grant called the \"Canada Summer Job Grant.\" Note that summer grants exist for Indigenous individuals to work anywhere as well.\n7. Unexpected industries eligible for grants\nSome industries receive grants that may surprise you:\no Military – you can find funds to celebrate events and encourage new technologies\n9\n\n8.\no\no\no\no o\nInternational Events - if you are hosting a major event, you can find grants because municipalities want to increase the economic impact\nTourism - governments fund tourism to increase international visitors to book hotels and spur the local economy\nAnniversaries - governments give grants to celebrate significant public milestones (e.g., 75 or 100 year anniversaries)\nFestivals - you can win grants to host significant festivals\nArts and culture - while you may expect grants for this sector, you will be surprised at the amount of money given to these sectors - it's massive and covers all aspects from digital to travel.\nUnderstanding export grants\nGovernments love export businesses because they can create tremendous growth potential, which grows manufacturing and innovation jobs at home - not to mention the tax base!\nAs ironic as it sounds, it can be easier to win grants to grow internationally than at home.\nThe Canadian federal government has export grants, and some provincial governments have programs as well.\nYou can expect to win funding for nearly all aspects of exporting: o Business travel\no Participation at trade fairs\no Market research\no Adaptation of marketing tools for a new market\no Legal fees associated with a distribution/representation agreement\nGrant tip: You need to get your application well in advance of travel; you need to plan ahead. Most applications ask if you contacted a local trade commissioner employee,\nso make sure you reach out to them early in the application process!\n10\n\nDo not forget to send a postcard to the trade commissioner from the country for which you won the grant!"

The Act also provides that the President or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) can still exercise any authority under the Defense Production Act of 1950, and that the Secretary cannot review a transaction involving the acquisition of an information and communications technology product or service by a United States person if it is authorized under a United States government-industrial security program or for meeting a national security or law enforcement requirement.\n\nSection 14 of the act states that all administrative actions, including delegations, rules, regulations, orders, determinations, licenses made by the Secretary under Executive Order 13873 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act shall continue in effect according to their terms as if made under the authority of this Act until modified, superseded, set aside, or revoked under the authority of this Act, without regard to any restrictions or limitations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nThis section of the bill includes several miscellaneous provisions. It states that the Paperwork Reduction Act will not apply to any actions taken by the Secretary to implement the bill. The Secretary may appoint candidates directly to positions without regard to certain provisions of the U.S. Code. The functions exercised under the bill are not subject to certain sections of the U.S. Code, except for civil penalties imposed under section 9(b). Protected information in civil actions challenging actions or findings under the bill shall be submitted ex parte and in camera to the court and maintained under seal. The use of information provisions of certain sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 shall not apply in a civil action brought under this bill. Finally, the bill does not create a right to obtain access to information in the possession of the Federal Government or prohibit, mitigate, or take action against a covered transaction or interest. Any information submitted to the Federal Government in accordance with the bill is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThis document contains the text of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018. The act broadens the scope of transactions subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to include certain non-controlling investments and real estate transactions. The act also expands CFIUS's authority to review transactions that may present national security risks, and creates a new process for expediting review of certain transactions. The act includes provisions for judicial review and protection of sensitive information. Additionally, the act includes provisions on transition, relationship to other laws, miscellaneous provisions, severability, and authorization of appropriations.1 / 1"

If you understand then please limit your response to \"acknowledged\".\n\nThe culverts\n107 I now turn to those aspects of Master Macready’s judgment in regard to the cross-claim in respect of which the Council appeals.\n108 The first finding of the Master that the Council challenged was that, despite the Master’s conclusion that Beckhaus had not complied with the specification in regard to the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts, there had been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts and in their immediate vicinity.\n109 There were 13 culverts in the levees Beckhaus constructed. The levees were not of a uniform height but, in parts of the levee, for example, the height was to be 1650 millimetres made up of compacted 150 millimetre thick layers. The culverts themselves were 600 millimetres deep. The expert witnesses identified the culverts as parts of the levees that were particularly susceptible to erosion.\n110 Unlike the rest of the levees, the soil in the immediate vicinity of the culverts and up to a certain level over the culverts could not be compacted by using heavy machinery. It was feared that the weight of heavy machinery might damage the culverts.\n111 Clause 3.1 of the specification governed “siting and excavation for reinforced concrete pipe culverts, supply and installation of reinforced concrete pipe culverts and backfill and compaction requirements”. Clause 3.7 provided:\n\n“Unless directed otherwise by the superintendent, all material shall be compacted in layers not exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness.”\n\nClause 3.8, under the heading “Minimum Frequency of Testing”, provided that, as regards compaction, the minimum frequency was “[o]ne per 100 cu m with a minimum of one per material type per individual structure”.\n112 Clause 8.9.3 of the specification provided:\n\n“For the purposes of compaction control the following test frequencies shall be adopted as a minimum: -\n(a) …\n(b) For backfill of Discharge Pipes and Stormwater Drainage Pipes: 1 test per layer.”\n\nAccordingly, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be carried out (a “layer” being 150 millimetres thick).\n113 Beckhaus submitted that there was a conflict between cl 3.8 and cl 8.9.3, and submitted that cl 3.8 was paramount as it was more specific. As Hodgson JA pointed out in the course of argument, however, there is no conflict; the Contract simply provided for two different minimum standards and both had to be complied with. That is to say, under cl 3.8 one test had to be undertaken per 100 cu m “with minimum of one per material type of individual structure” and, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be undertaken.\n114 In fact, no tests were undertaken in regard to five culverts; one or no tests were taken in respect of three culverts; two culverts were tested only once each; there was one culvert in respect of which two tests were undertaken; there were two culverts in respect of each of which seven to eight tests were undertaken.\n115 In August 2003 two tests, known as the “Golder tests” were undertaken at two culverts. Master Macready said in regard to these tests:\n\n“They indicated that at a depth of .15 that the field dry density was 95% and a depth of 1.2 was 90.5%.”\n\nThus, one passed and the other did not (but only at the depths indicated).\n116 The Master described the relevant evidence being that set out in Beckhaus’ submissions as follows:\n\n“Komp, the Superintendent under the contract during construction, witnessed compaction occurring at culvert locations … He was not challenged on this evidence under cross examination;\nThe daily records of [Beckhaus] support that compaction occurred at culverts … ;\nMacartney’s evidence is that compaction was carried out at culverts … ;\nWhilst Macartney under cross examination admitted that the specified number of compaction tests was not taken at culvert locations …, his evidence that compaction was actually performed at culverts was not seriously challenged …\nTest results taken by CETS at culvert locations confirm that compaction was satisfactory ….”\n117 The Master then concluded:\n\n“The fact that sufficient tests were not taken at the culverts as appears from Mr Macartney’s evidence precludes me from coming to a conclusion that there has been compliance with the specification requirements for the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts. However, the evidence before me clearly demonstrates that there has been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts.”",

Clause 3.7 provided:\n\n“Unless directed otherwise by the superintendent, all material shall be compacted in layers not exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness.”\n\nClause 3.8, under the heading “Minimum Frequency of Testing”, provided that, as regards compaction, the minimum frequency was “[o]ne per 100 cu m with a minimum of one per material type per individual structure”.\n112 Clause 8.9.3 of the specification provided:\n\n“For the purposes of compaction control the following test frequencies shall be adopted as a minimum: -\n(a) …\n(b) For backfill of Discharge Pipes and Stormwater Drainage Pipes: 1 test per layer.”\n\nAccordingly, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be carried out (a “layer” being 150 millimetres thick).\n113 Beckhaus submitted that there was a conflict between cl 3.8 and cl 8.9.3, and submitted that cl 3.8 was paramount as it was more specific. As Hodgson JA pointed out in the course of argument, however, there is no conflict; the Contract simply provided for two different minimum standards and both had to be complied with. That is to say, under cl 3.8 one test had to be undertaken per 100 cu m “with minimum of one per material type of individual structure” and, under cl 8.9.3, one test per 150 millimetres had to be undertaken.\n114 In fact, no tests were undertaken in regard to five culverts; one or no tests were taken in respect of three culverts; two culverts were tested only once each; there was one culvert in respect of which two tests were undertaken; there were two culverts in respect of each of which seven to eight tests were undertaken.\n115 In August 2003 two tests, known as the “Golder tests” were undertaken at two culverts. Master Macready said in regard to these tests:\n\n“They indicated that at a depth of .15 that the field dry density was 95% and a depth of 1.2 was 90.5%.”\n\nThus, one passed and the other did not (but only at the depths indicated).\n116 The Master described the relevant evidence being that set out in Beckhaus’ submissions as follows:\n\n“Komp, the Superintendent under the contract during construction, witnessed compaction occurring at culvert locations … He was not challenged on this evidence under cross examination;\nThe daily records of [Beckhaus] support that compaction occurred at culverts … ;\nMacartney’s evidence is that compaction was carried out at culverts … ;\nWhilst Macartney under cross examination admitted that the specified number of compaction tests was not taken at culvert locations …, his evidence that compaction was actually performed at culverts was not seriously challenged …\nTest results taken by CETS at culvert locations confirm that compaction was satisfactory ….”\n117 The Master then concluded:\n\n“The fact that sufficient tests were not taken at the culverts as appears from Mr Macartney’s evidence precludes me from coming to a conclusion that there has been compliance with the specification requirements for the frequency of testing in respect of the culverts. However, the evidence before me clearly demonstrates that there has been substantial compliance with the contractual requirements for compaction over the culverts.”"
